# Notes about max sliding window

There's a Ruby and a C version implemented. Tests are implemented for both, and
in both cases tests are written in Ruby.

Run tests for Ruby version:
```
ruby max_sliding_window_test.rb
```

Run tests for C versionN:
```
make test_ruby
```

There's also a _dbg.h_ file defined, implementing useful debugging macros from
the book "Learn C the hard way". These macros are not used in the solutions,
however, since they cannot be submitted to Coursera. They are defined here just
for reference.
